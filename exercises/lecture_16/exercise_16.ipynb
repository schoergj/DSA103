    "# Lecture 16 Data Wrangling: Evaluating a Retrosynthesis Model\n",
    "\n",
    "## The Challenge of Retrosynthesis\n",
    "\n",
    "One of the fundamental problems in synthetic chemistry is **retrosynthesis**: given a target molecule (product), can we identify the starting materials (reactants) needed to synthesize it? This is essentially working backwards from the desired outcome to determine the recipe.\n",
    "\n",
    "In recent years, machine learning models have been trained to predict retrosynthetic routes. These models take a target product molecule as input and suggest possible sets of reactants that could be used to make it. However; **How do we know if these predictions are actually good?**\n",
    "\n",
    "## What is Round-Trip Accuracy?\n",
    "\n",
    "Round-trip accuracy is an evaluation metric for retrosynthesis models that leverages the relationship between forward and backward reaction prediction:\n",
    "\n",
    "![round trip accuracy](roundtrip.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "### The Process:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Start with a target molecule** (e.g., aspirin)\n",
    "2. **Use a retrosynthesis model** to predict what reactants could make it\n",
    "3. **Use a forward reaction model** to predict what product those reactants would actually make\n",
    "4. **Compare the predicted product with the original target**\n",
    "   - If they match → the retrosynthesis prediction was likely good! ✓\n",
    "   - If they don't match → the prediction was probably incorrect ✗\n",
    "\n",
    "### Why This Works:\n",
    "\n",
    "Round-trip accuracy is based on a simple insight: if a retrosynthesis model predicts reactants R for a target product P, then a forward model should predict that R produces P. If the forward model predicts a different product, the retrosynthetic prediction is questionable.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Your Task\n",
    "\n",
    "In this exercise, you will implement a complete pipeline to calculate round-trip accuracy for a set of retrosynthetic predictions. In our scenario, the forward model is accessible via API and as calling the forward model is expensive we already have the outcome of a set of reactions cached. \n",
    "Your task will be:\n",
    "- to load the dataset \n",
    "- clean it removing invalid predictions\n",
    "- check for which reactions we already know the outcome from the cache\n",
    "- call a mock API simulating the forward model for the remaining ones\n",
    "- calculate the round trip accuracy\n",
    "\n",
    "### The Dataset\n",
    "\n",
    "You'll work with retrosynthesis predictions from a real model that include several challenges:\n",
    "- Some predictions have invalid SMILES strings\n",
    "- Some reactions are trivial (product = reactants)\n",
    "- Some reactions have already been evaluated (cached)\n",
    "- Data may contain whitespace and formatting issues\n",
    "\n",
    "Your job is to clean the data, validate the chemistry, make API calls to a forward model, and ultimately calculate how often the forward model agrees with the retrosynthesis predictions.\n",
    "\n",
    "## SMILES\n",
    "\n",
    "In this exercise we will be working with SMILES, a text format for molecules. For example the SMILES representation of Aspirin is: `CC(=O)Oc1ccccc1C(=O)O`. You can visualise SMILES by using this website: https://www.simolecule.com/cdkdepict/depict.html. \n",
    "\n",
    "Note: Our SMILES sometimes contain the character ~. To visualise molecules containing ~, remove the ~ before passing it to the website."
